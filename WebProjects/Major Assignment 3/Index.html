      <h3>How I got here!</h3>
      <p>Throughout my highschool career I only had one goal in mind, which was to be accepted at the University of Central Florida. 
        After four long years of building up my ACT scores, in addition to two years of dual enrollment at Florida Gulf Coast University, I finally did it! 
        However, when I applied to UCF, I had to decide which major I wanted to take since I would be enrolling as a junior. 
        I was dreading this decision because I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. 
        I always enjoyed watching and analyzing films, so I decided to see if I could get a career in the film industry. 
        I originally planned to apply to UCF as a film major, however, since that field is very competitive and can be accomplished with or without a film major, I decided to change my major to Digital Media, specifically in the web design track.      </p>

      <h3>What I have learned so far!</h3>
        <p>I decided to choose this major because I wanted to learn a valuable skill that I know will benefit me in securing a job that will pay well. 
          In addition to that, I always enjoyed looking behind the scenes in anything, not just film, and websites are no exceptions! 
          As I finish my first year at UCF, to say that I learned a lot is a vast understatement! 
          I have grown familiar with Adobe Suite and its softwares such as Photoshop and Illustrator and am starting to become more confident in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

        <h3>This is just the beginning!</h3>
        <p>However, just because my original plan had to change, doesn’t mean that I plan to ditch it all together since I am also working towards a minor in Cinema Studies. 
          Something that I enjoyed doing during high school was writing film reviews and I even created my own website through Blogger.com. 
          I made this website without any knowledge of web design, so looking back at now, I can see so many ways where I can improve it! 
          I haven’t written any reviews recently but thanks to the skills that I am starting to develop through UCF, I can begin to build my own website from scratch, which I am pretty excited for to say the least! 
          I cannot wait to see what I can learn and accomplish as my journey at UCF goes on!
