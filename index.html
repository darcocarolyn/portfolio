I'm majoring in Digital Media, specifically in web design. My interests include reading, writing, and film. I am considering a career in the film industry. However, for what career exactly, I am not sure. I currently have no major accomplishments but I am currently writing my first short film. With my major, I plan to work for companies such as Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios.  Another possible career that I am interested in is becoming a film critic since I enjoy writing film reviews on the side. </p>
            <p style="border:5px; border-style:solid; width: 450px; border-color:##000000; padding: 10px; position:absolute; left: 600px; top: 265px;">Chris Stuckman is a film critic on Youtube. He influences me because he always gave an in depth analysis of each film he reviewed. He never gave a review as simple as “I enjoyed it and you should go see it”. He always explained why something in the film worked and why something didn’t. He recently began to make feature length films and he has posted videos on his experience directing them, which I found very useful and inspiring to me. Steven Spielburg is one of my favorite film directors due to his impact in the film industry. He created the first summer blockbuster, Jaws, at the age of 27 and his perseverance and determination is something that I would like to reflect in my own work.</p>
