          <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>If I had to describe scuba diving in one word, it would be freedom.
          From the moment I entered the water, all of my worries and stress disappeared.
          The only thing that was on my mind was how peaceful and relaxing the ocean was.
          All I could hear was my breathing… breathing in.. breathing out.. while enjoying this new world and its inhabitants around me. 
          Life underwater, as I discovered during my scuba diving experience, was more beautiful than I imagined, and the tranquillity was unparalleled to anything I have experienced before.
          Something I hadn’t really considered was just how human-centric our lives are on land.
          Everything seems to revolve around ourselves, with our own needs and desires.
          However, when you enter the marine world as a diver, it’s a different story entirely.
          Every dive is a unique experience and I enjoy it without thinking that my life is not perfect or that I could have done more. 
          Scuba diving erases all these from my mind and offers me the wonderful feeling of freedom.
