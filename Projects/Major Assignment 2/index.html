        <h1>The Beauty Underneath</h1>

        <p>The boat slowly approached the dive site as the captain brought the throttle to a stop and dropped the anchor. 
          The idea of leaving the world I knew and entering into something far mysterious and oblivious was undoubtedly scary. 
          To say that I was anxious for my first real dive experience was an understatement and those feelings only grew as the boat continued to sway over the waves. 
          I geared up, double and triple checked my gear and I was all set and ready to go. 
          As I dropped into the sea I could feel the freshness of the salty water on my skin and all I could focus on was my first descent into the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>A smooth initial descent was a harbinger of good things to come and even more so as I began to glimpse this new world under me. 
          In what seemed like forever, I finally hit the bottom and the sea became amazing and breathtaking as I waited for the rest of my group to join me. The ocean’s surface was merely a blanket concealing the beauty underneath. 
          Unlike in big cities, where your vision is hindered by numerous obstacles, all I saw underwater was clear-cut beauty. I was in awe of the sheer magnificence of it all and just wanted time to stand still and take it all in. 
          The coral reef was vibrant and colorful, home to many creatures. There were fish all around me, big and small, weaving in and out through the reef. A stingray laid hidden under a bunch of rocks and a sea turtle swam closer to our group, curious to see its new guests. 
          It is a feeling unlike no other when there are sea creatures just inches away from you. 
          I was in awe of the sheer magnificence of it all and just wanted time to stand still as the minutes flew by.
          Unfortunatly, I was rudely interrupted by my computer indicating that I was left with low levels of oxygen and I reluctantly began my climb back to the surface.


        </p>
        <p>If I had to describe scuba diving in one word, it would be freedom. 
          From the moment I entered the water, all of my worries and stress disappeared. 
          The only thing that was on my mind was how peaceful and relaxing the ocean was. 
          All I could hear was my breathing… breathing in.. breathing out.. while enjoying this new world and its inhabitants around me. 
          Life underwater, as I discovered during my scuba diving experience, was more beautiful than I imagined, and the tranquillity was unparalleled to anything I have experienced before.
          Something I hadn’t really considered was just how human-centric our lives are on land. 
          Everything seems to revolve around ourselves, with our own needs and desires.
          However, when you enter the marine world as a diver, it’s a different story entirely. 
          Every dive is a unique experience and I enjoy it without thinking that my life is not perfect or that I could have done more. 
          Scuba diving erases all these from my mind and offers me the wonderful feeling of freedom.
