    <!--Brief History-->
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p id= "p1">
            The first real significant movement in horror came from Germany in the wake of World War I. 
            While the country was struggling to get back on its feet financially, German art culture was radically revitalized. 
            Filmmakers were seeking to realize bold, abstract themes through wildly inventive cinematic techniques that pushed the visually expressive capabilities of the medium to a new level. 
            These films portray a cinematic world that would seem weird and unnerving to the average viewer and draws from mythic allegories to reflect upon the struggles of the day. 
            They were generally dark in nature, capitalizing on the deep contrast of light and darkness as well as reflecting the subjective distortion of characters in moral crisis or with a frantic psyche. 
            Two significant films that led the movement were<em> The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</em> (1920) and <em>Nosferatu</em> (1922). This highly influential movement, now known as German Expressionism, gave birth to the horror genre that we all know today.

        <h3>
            <em>Dracula</em> (1931)</p>
    </h3>
        <p id="p1">
            <em>Nosferatu</em> has made its mark on history, not only as the first vampire film, but also as a prominent example of the German Expressionism movement. 
            So it surprises no one that the <em>Dracula</em> followed suit and adapted a similar style. 
            It was the first major horror film of the sound era, and with its resounding success in 1931, set the stage for the next major development in horror history. 
            The look of <em>Dracula</em> emphasized the deep contrast of expressionistic lighting and <em>Nosferatu</em> is an unmistakable influence with its usage of shadowed imagery throughout the film. 
            <em>Dracula</em> set the tone for the other Universal monsters such as <em>Frankenstien</em>, <em>The Wolf Man</em>, and <em>The Mummy</em>.

        <!--Psycho-->
        <h3>
            <em>Psyhco</em> (1960)

        <p id="p1">
            The influence of <em>Psycho&apos;s</em> psychological horror and its success in Hollywood on modern horror stories is undeniable. 
            However, it is no mystery that the influence on Hitchcock&apos;s film came from German expressionism. 
            In <em>Psycho</em>, we&apos;re given a horror movie devoid of supernatural monsters and instead brings us a human monster, suffering from psychosexual problems. 
            This change of character created the psychological horror film, where the malevolence of the horror takes place within ourselves that others can&apos;t see, rather from an outside source that can either be stopped or controlled.

            Tim Burton is one of the most well known directors due to his unique style and the manner of films he creates. 
            To say that his films were slightly influenced by German Expressionism is an understatement. 
            The environment that his films take place in are very wacky and almost dreamlike, with skewed angles and twisted trees. 
            His films are extremely similar to <em>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</em> and a notable example is <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> (1999). 
            The setting of the film is very gothic and the lighting is heavily manipulated, especially when the Headless Horseman appears. 
            Whenever he appears, there is always a flash of lights which creates high contrast visuals.
